# jsonschema-api
Middleware enabling validation of JSON payloads sent to[Express]( https://github.com/visionmedia/express )API endpoints against JSON Schemas.

## Why validate with JSON schemas?

- **Simple** - JSON schemas are a simple and expressive,[standard](http://json-schema.org/)way to describe the data that your API expects to receive.
- **Standard** - That part where you have to design and implement a payload description and validation model? Already done.
- **Safe** - Your application never sees payloads that fail to validate. Failures are isolated and self-managing, external to your application logic.
- **Expressive** - Validation errors precisely identify the location and type of error, with the validation rules open and accessible.
- **Expressive** - Creating a JSON Schema documents API requirements.
- **Expressive** - JSON Schemas extend JSON syntax, providing a powerful and well understood data-interchange format for distributed applications.
